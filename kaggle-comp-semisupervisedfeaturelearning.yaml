description: Semi-Supervised Feature Learning. There's been a lot of recent work done
  in unsupervised feature learning for classification and there are a ton of older
  methods that also work well. The purpose of this competition is to find out which
  of these methods work best on relatively large-scale high dimensional learning tasks.
