name: uci-heterogeneity-activity-recognition
description: The Heterogeneity Human Activity Recognition (HHAR) dataset from Smartphones
  and Smartwatches is a dataset devised to benchmark human activity recognition algorithms
  (classification, automatic data segmentation, sensor fusion, feature extraction,
  etc.) in real-world contexts; specifically, the dataset is gathered with a variety
  of different device models and use-scenarios, in order to reflect sensing heterogeneities
  to be expected in real deployments.
